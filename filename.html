t’s a slow day for us, no big km to cover, so a ride to the local fruit shop to stock up then an 8 km ride into Annecy to see the tourist sights. The old town is full of little shops selling tourist stuff, some tasteful, most not.

It is crawling with tourists, crawling at a slow pace everywhere. There are even wheelchairs propelled by a cyclist, bit like a cycle rickshaw. On the bike track in I observe a man roller blading with a pusher out front. That’s nice, taking his baby out, but on closer observation that’s no baby it’s his dog in the pusher. Dogs in trailers behind the bike are common, and dogs sitting on a platform attached to the bar, but a dog in a pusher is a first.

An excellent coffee and a quick look around is sufficient, we are returning at 1400 with Isobelle by car. I have seen enough to make me pleased that our Gît is 8 km from Annecy.

The longer look around in the afternoon includes a one hour boat ride of the lake, interesting apart from a few bits when the sun on my back put me to sleep, so I can’t say much about that.

Pamela phoned a restaurant to book for dinner, when we arrived it was firmly closed. After enquiring with locals in fractured French we discovered where she had phoned was about 1.5 km away, so off we trotted. On arriving it looked most unpromising, a large place with two patrons with tats, so turned heel and went to the place we dined at the precious evening – splendid meal. The perils of limited language.

Saint Helene to Annecy | Tuesday 2 September
Leave a reply	

Today is a 55 km ride to Lake Annecy, our final destination, from where we hand the bikes back. Fortunately we have negotiated to keep the bikes for another two days while in Annecy. A good thing because we are 7 km out of Annecy.

http://www.france.fr/en/sites-and-monuments/lake-annecy.html

It is mainly bike track from Saint Helen to Albertville, with magnificent scenery.

IMG_0738-0.JPG

On arrival at Ugine we run into a bunch of Americans on a supported road bike tour. One of them tells me he runs bike tours of the mid west, his company Lizard Head. http://lizardheadcyclingguides.com.

A girl in the group enquiries where we are from, and on learning Australia breaks into “Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi”.

Cycling in the mid west does sound interesting. Something for another year.

On leaving Ugine it’s 35 km to Annecy on a wide bike path all the way, adjacent to the road and the same width. A steady stream of cyclists and a few roller blade-ers are progressing toward Annecy on a steady but gradual climb into an increasing head wind. A peleton of four zip past, setting a cracking pace so I lift the rate and latch onto the back, it’s better than fighting the head wind alone. A few km of drafting behind this group makes for easier cycling.

Another 10 km provides a cautionary warning, an ambulance on the track retrieving a downed cyclist surrounded by five of his fellows. He looks in bad shape, with neck brace on, and lots of skin off, as the ambos delicately lift him from track to stretcher. I will slow down a wee bit.

The nearer to Annecy we become the thicker the track with cyclists, time for caution with a track covered in doddering cyclists and kids, each wandering about and stopping without hand signals, a situation ripe for a crash. As difficult as it is to anticipate every capricious move of those ahead it is prudent to take care with roller blades who are texting, they wander into oncoming bikes in a nano second. Why would they do that?

Pamela follows the direction to our accommodation, third turn off the cycle track, and 500 metre along the side track is our Gîte, no problem. What a delight it is.

Aix les Bains to Saint Helene sur-isere | Monday 1 September

Another day of ups and downs. The first 20 km of 60 km we do in ease, along a great bike path flanked by a lake.

IMG_0717.JPG

We stop for coffee at Chamberay.

IMG_0719.JPG

Then at 20 km the climbs commence, to take us through a number of quaint villages, narrow streets and architecture that suggests they would have benefited for an architect or two over the last few hundred years.

Square houses with shutters to block out the sun. One in particular epitomises the lack of thought, a lot like Australian houses one may respond. A large house with the southerly sun bearing down on wall facing south, no overhang, and all shutters closed to ward off the sun. Dumb design, in plentiful supply.

As we progress the villages we run out of road at the 35 km mark. After many turn arounds to get back on track we find the route Garmin suggests, no insists, a narrow flinty track between vineyards which varies between round washed rocks, dangerous to ride on, to sharp flints which will readily slash a side wall of a road bike. Are they fucking mad setting such a course? It is so bad we walk the bikes on and off for a kilometre, and ride the rest at walking speed.

We return to bitumen after a few km, where the pace picks up. So slow has been the pace 1 p.m. is upon us, with hunger gnawing and no food in sight. Our only sustenance an apple and muesli bar long ago consumed by Pamela. Pammy is just about to take bites out of the saddle leather, so I gallantly donate her my muesli bar, then with remarkable fortune steal a tomato from over a fence and donate that to ameliorate Pammy’s craving. We enquire of a local of cafés – nothing she tells us, nothing for many km. If this continues we will hit La Bonk, a serious issue for cyclists, and no it is not sexy.

We have not ridden 300 metres from resigning ourselves to no hope of food when we stumble upon a cafe, no ordinary cafe, but with quiches, and glorious salads. The owner said she was on holiday until yesterday, this is her first day open. So food, glorious food, followed by coffee which fortifies the legs for another 20 km.

A good thing too, plenty more up and down, before we reach our destination.

The accommodation at Saint Helene sur-isere, when we reach the hamlet, proves elusive. Every turn we take is a dead end, or off course. Finally we blindly follow Garmin along a road that appears to lead to an industrial area, with cemetery thrown in, this cannot be correct and another 500 meters is our accommodation, a large convention centre type place, at which we are the only guests! Extraordinary.

It is adjacent to a delightful park and swimming lake, in which children are frolicking.

Seyssel to Aix Les Bains | Sunday 31 August
1 Reply	

A morning blue sky greets us, but a late start after sleeping in. We didn’t get to breakfast until 0745. I blame it on the stress of traversing Geneve. So much for our planned early start. But on the road by 0845 on a bike track by a shimmering lake, then at 2.4 km – bugger. I have left my money belt with all my € plus passport in my case to be transported. I can live with stolen € but not without passport, so 180 degree and zip back. No problem, belt retrieved and buckled to expanding waist line and back to pick up Pamela lake-gazing by the track.

The more we pedal the more spectacular it becomes, how much beauty can we endure? We come to a small village at 11 am but there seems no prospect of coffee so press on, and in no more than 200 metres we round a corner to a village centre full of coffee drinkers, fancy motor cycles, including a red Motto Guzzi, not sure which was better, the bike or pillion passenger, and a Lotus car club with more yellow Lotus Elans than one can shake a stick at. There is a minor traffic jam in the narrow main Street with motor homes and Lotus jostling for room. All is serene on the river with hoards of canoeists paddling by.

It is an easy ride, we arrive at Aix Le Bains with no pains, except that of finding our hotel. After many false turns we find a tiny hotel in the Main Street, with an equally tiny room, with what prove to be paper thin walls, and a Mickey Mouse shower hand piece that lavishly sprays water around the bathroom. How is it that bathroom technology has by passed France.

There is not a lot happening in Aix of a Sunday afternoon. We wander the closed shopping strip, as do the locals, find a delightful park, as have the locals, then saunter back to be surprised by the sound of an orchestra in the distance. A turn to the right reveals the village rotunda, just like most Australian towns had, with a small orchestra playing to an appreciative crowd. It has four strings, three brass, flute, Oboe, woodwind, tymphony producing sweet music.

IMG_0713.JPG

A beer in the square with a fine orchestra, and an enthusiastic audience, there is little language barrier with music.

Then a hunt for dinner, made easy by little choice. Our luck is in, an enjoyable meal and then retire to a single bed that is too short, with a mattress that has a hollow centre.

Not a lot to complain about when I contrast it with my dear Grandfather’s experience of France, freezing water logged trenches, nightly shelling and sorties into no mans land to capture a few Fritzes, then being mustard gassed by the Germans; not a lot t
